    <p><i>The Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is a long-range, high-altitude, strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed and
            manufactured <br />by the American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. It was operated by both the
            United
            States Air Force (USAF) and <br />NASA.</i></p>

    <p>The SR-71 was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by
        Lockheed's <br />Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was responsible for
        many
        of the aircraft's<br /> innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one
        of
        the first aircraft to be designed<br /> with a reduced radar cross-section. At one point, a bomber variant of
        the
        aircraft was under consideration, before the program<br /> was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission
        equipment for
        the reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a <br />side-looking airborne radar, and a photo
        camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier than the A-12, allowing it hold more<br /> fuel as well as a
        two-seat
        cockpit. The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff <br />General
        Curtis
        LeMay, who preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS (Reconnaissance). The
        <br />aircraft
        was introduced to operational service in January 1966.
